# overview of c
<ul>
<li>c is a high level language and low level language so it is also called mid or middle level language.</li>

<li>It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T(american telegraph and telecommunication) bell laboratory of USA in 1972.</li>
<li>It was derived from BCPL(Basic combine programming language).</li>
<li>It is set to be mother language of all programming language.</li>
<li>The main objective of c language is to developed system software as operating system , linker , loader , compiler , network driver etc.</li>

<li> unix operating system was written with in c programming.</li>
<li>it is case sensitive programming language it means lower case is not equivalent to upper case.</li>
</ul>
<b>Advantage of c</b>
<ul>
<li>It support procedural programming language / modular programming/ structural conventional programming.<br> it is  a programming technique in which a large program can be devide into multiple parts called function or module so we can say that this technique reduce the complexity of the program.<br>
This concept is implemented with the help of function.</li>
<li>it is portable language because it can be executed on different operating system such as windows, linux , max etc.</li>

<li>it is richest of library function such as mathematical function, string function , character function , date and time function.</li>
<li>it is compile bsaed language so its execution is fast.</li>
<li>it supports graphics programming . in this case we can design different shape as human face, car design , etc.</li>
<li>it also support game programming due to graphics.</li>
<li>It supports system programming in this case we can design system software. such as os, compiler, interpreter etc.</li>
<li>It also supports application programming in this case we can design application software such as school management system hospital management system etc.</li>

</ul>
<b>Disadvantages of c</b>
<ul>
<li>It is platform dependent/ machine dependent it is major drawback of c.</li>
<li>it does not supports object oriented programming language.</li>
<li>it is not secure language.</li>
<li>It does not support database directly.</li>
</ul>

<b>application of c</b>
<ul>
<li>use to design system software</li>
<li>use to design application software.</li>
<li>use to design game programming</li>
<li>it is use in DBMS.</li>
<li>It is use in robotics.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Token's in c</b>
<p></p>Tokens are the smallest unit of c and c++. That are used to develop a program.</p>
There are some tokens in c.
<ul>
<li>Character set.</li>
<li>Constant</li>
<li>Variable</li>
<li>Operator</li>
<li>Date type</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Identifier</li>
<li>Escape sequence.</li>
<li>Type specifier / format specifier.</li>
<l>comment</l>
<li>Expression.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Operator</h2>
<p>Operator is a symbol which is used to perform operation between operand.</p>
<b>There are following types of operator</b>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic operator</li>
<li>Relational operator</li>
<li>Logical operator</li>
<li>Assignment operator</li>
<li>increment operator</li>
<li>Decrement operator</li>
<li>size of operator</li>
<li>Bitwise operator</li>

</ul>
<!-- control statement -->
<h2>Control statement</h2>
<p>control statement is used to control the flow of execution of the program.</p>
<b>Types of control statement</b>
<ul>
<li>conditional statement</li>
<li>looping statement</li>
<li>jumping statement</li>
</ul>
