<h1><a href="array">Array</a></h1>
<ul>
<!-- overview of array -->
<li>Array is a linear data structure that works in linear function.</li>
<li>it is a special variable which is used to store multiple values of same type.</li>
<li>The value of array can be accessed with the help of index value.</li>
</ul>
<!-- advantage of array -->
<b>Advantage of array</b>
<ul>
<li>it store multiple values at a time.</li>
<li>it provides simple operation like insertion / deletion/searching/sorting.</li>
</ul>
<!-- disadvantage of array -->
<b>Disadvantage of array</b>
<ul>
<li>It support static memory allocation. it is a technique is which memory is allocated during compile time. in this case memory is wasted due to fixed size of array. it is major drawback of array.</li>
<li>it stores same types of values. But it can be avoided with the help of structure. </li>
<li>it execution is slow rather than pointer</li>
</ul>
<!-- types of array -->
<b>Types of array</b>
there are three types of array
<ol>
<li>one dimensional array.</li>
<li>Two dimensional array.</li>
<li>Three dimensional array.</li>
</ol>
